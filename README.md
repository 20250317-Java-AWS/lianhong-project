# Joke Generator ðŸ¤£

## Description  
The **Joke Generator** is an Angular Single Page Application (SPA) that uses the free [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) to fetch and display jokes based on user-selected categories.  

On the **home page**, users can select one or more joke categories such as **Programming**, **Pun**, **Misc**, or **Dark**. When they click the **"New Joke"** button, the app fetches a random joke from those selected categories.  

The app first displays the **setup** part of the joke (like a question). A second button, labeled **"What?"**, lets the user reveal the **delivery** or punchline of the joke.

## Concepts  

- âœ… **SPA Route Navigation** â€“ All interaction happens within a single page. Additional routes like `/favorites` or `/svg` can be added later.
- âœ… **Consume a RESTful API** â€“ Uses the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) to fetch real-time jokes based on user-selected categories.
- âœ… **User Interaction** â€“ Users can choose joke categories, get a new joke, and reveal the punchline.
- âœ… **Multiple Components** â€“ The app includes:
  - `HomeComponent`: Displays category options and two liner jokes with interaction
  - `SingleComponent`: Displays category options and one liner jokes with interaction
  - `FavoritesComponent`: View and manage saved jokes
